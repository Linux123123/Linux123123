# Hello everybody

I am **a small creator** from the world of all things. 

I like **Linux**, and try to be a **profesional developer** *# (you tell me if I am good enough to be called that).*

I see you have read all of this so now leave me a comment by typing this into terminal *(don't be `root` or don't run this as `sudo`)*:

``` bash
dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sda status=progress bs=512B
```
